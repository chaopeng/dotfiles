# Browser scripts

This dir contains scripts to launch browsers from command line and spotlight on Mac.

## From command line

Example:

```sh
# open a URL on browser with personal account
open-chrome life google.ca

# search "rust 101" on google
goog rust 101

# search "rust 101" videos on youtube
yt rust 101
```

## Spotlight

The idea is to use Shortcuts app on Mac, create shortcut:

1. Ask fot text
2. Run Shell Script
